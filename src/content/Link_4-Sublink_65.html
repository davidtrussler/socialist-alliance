urban areas, regaining control of a number of Councils.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The BNP failed to make the
Parliamentary breakthrough they had threatened, and they lost a large number of

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Times">18 different
left organizations had stood 121 candidates between them, gaining 55,596 votes,
an average of 1.5%.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This was
no worse – or better – than 2001 (Socialist Alliance) or 2005 (SP) but, with
the recession, high unemployment, public spending and benefits cuts, Iraq and
Afghanistan he felt the Left should have done better, and had not been helped
by the lack of unity evident in the high number of different campaigns. He went
on to outline the view being increasingly put forward that the Left should
seriously consider re-joining Labour and re-claiming it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>His own view was that </span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">there had to be </span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Times">a working class response to the Crisis,
particularly the Public Spending cuts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The Left needed to unite and help organise the resistance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>That response would be better
co-ordinated if it is part of a movement to build a new Left umbrella organization/party,
and that needed to be done quickly otherwise the LRC view would resonate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>We needed a timescale for a new Left
Party otherwise we will not move forward. What we do create must be inclusive

carry on with TUSC, with the CNWP, or even the SA?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"> </span>Standing as a Parliamentary candidate had changed his
outlook.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>He had only finally
decided to stand at the last minute after gaining £400 of the £500 needed for
the deposit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Subsequently, the
other £100 was raised, along with £400 for leaflets and £100 for a banner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>He had rarely been out on the streets,
but when he was he got support for promoting parliamentary and banking
reform.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The campaign had had an
effect within the University, but there was no organization on the ground in
Bermondsey.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>He would have done
better, he felt, if that organization had been built – he should have
registered ‘Republican Socialist Party’, he suggested.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>At this point, he would consider
