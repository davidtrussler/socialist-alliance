Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition (TUSC) &#8211; and a programme. 10% of general election seats would be contested by TUSC, which already had the support of two Trade Union General Secretaries and one Deputy Secretary.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>There was enthusiastic support in a number of localities, including Wigan, Brighton, Coventry, Portsmouth, Carlisle and Merseyside.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A meeting was taking place in Scotland to promote TUSC this weekend involving the CWU, PCS, RMT, FBU, Solidarity and Lanarkshire Socialist Alliance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Increasing numbers were getting involved with TUSC and, although at this stage it was no more than another step towards a new Party, Bob Crow was amongst those already publicly calling for a new Party after the General Election.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>He felt the progress made overall was positive, taking us further than we could have predicted twelve months ago.</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Times"><i>Terry Pearce</i></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Times"> reported on community activity against spending cuts in Bracknell, and argued TUSC should be part of such campaigns, especially as Council elections were likely to be on the same day as the General Election.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>He was uneasy about the way TUSC had been set up, feeling a certain mysticism surrounded the Core Group, although he felt the programme was quite supportable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>He argued the CNWP should be represented at the Core Group.</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Times"><i>Pete McLaren</i></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Times"> agreed, adding that he shared many of the concerns amongst the left about the lack of inclusivity and openness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>It was difficult to find out what was going on, although he appreciated individual reports regularly given him by Dave Nellist, and Clive Heemskirk had given a positive and informative report to the Left Unity Liaison Committee in late December.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>He was concerned that organisations had to prove their &apos;social weight&apos; before being able to get involved, and felt that with the RMT, CPB and AGS withdrawals, there was not really a Coalition as such.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>It was therefore important to include other supportive organisations &#8211; the Socialist Alliance had written on three separate occasions offering support and requesting involvement at national level.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>He also briefly referred to the AGS decision to withdraw, arguing their publicly stated reasons amounted to a sectarian attack on the SP.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>He concluded by explaining that despite his concerns, he fully supported TUSC and was already urging others to do so.</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Times"><i>Hannah Sell</i></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Times"> explained that TUSC was a modest project, and at one time the SP was unsure there would even be a General Election coalition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The RMT and CPB had hesitated because of their fears of a Tory government if Labour was not supported.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The Coalition was now off the ground, and three local RMT branches had already pledged support.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The AGS attitude at the Core Group had put trade unionists off the left which did not help pressing for wider involvement.</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Times">In reply to the discussion, <i>Dave Nellist</i></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Times"> reiterated the concerns trade unions had about doing anything to let the Tories in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>He outlined how other organisations were now coming on board &#8211; the DLP was discussing it, and the SWP, with six General election candidates, had asked to be part of TUSC.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The ability to stand candidates was more important than anything else when putting together a left coalition for the General Election as opposed to building a new Party.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The Core Group would look objectively at requests to get on board from all supportive organisations at its meeting this evening, but it would be concerned at involvement from those who had a history of using such initiatives purely for their own benefit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Times"></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Times">Arising out of the discussion, the following were agreed:</span></p>  <ul style="margin-top:0cm" type="square">  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Times">The CNWP fully supports the TUSC and   requests a representative on its Core Group/Steering Committee</span></li>  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Times">The CNWP agrees an initial fund of   &pound;500 to pay for transport to TUSP national committee meetings</span></li>  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Times">The CNWP agrees in principle to make   a donation to TUSC, the amount to be decided later</span></li> </ul>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Times"><b>EXTENDED STEERING COMMITTEE MEETING and CNWP CONFERENCE 2010</b></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Times">It was agreed to hold the following meetings/conference:</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Times"><i>Extended Steering Committee </i></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Times">- all CNWP members invited to join Steering Committee members in March:</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:108.0pt;text-indent:36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Times"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span><i>Dave Nellist</i></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Times"> agreed to write to members publicising what we have been</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:108.0pt;text-indent:36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Times"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>doing, advising of arrangements for the Extended Steering Committee and</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:108.0pt;text-indent:36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Times"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Conference, and promoting <span style="mso-tab-count: 1">   </span>membership<b></b></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Times"><i>Officers Meeting</i></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Times"> &#8211;
