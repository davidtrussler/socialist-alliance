<p>For discussions to commence about how best to approach all socialist unity projects ... progressive red/green groups and individuals - with a view to inviting all socialist unity projects, left organisations and independent socialists to a conference in 2008 to discuss ways of uniting the left into one mass socialist, democratic, open and pluralist organisation which recognises and protects each component part whilst pursuing  commonly agreed goals.</p>
<p>Our most urgent aim as the SA is to campaign for a new alliance of socialists which unites in one organisation the Labour Representation Committee, the CNWP, Respect, TUSP and the rest of the socialist and green socialist left, and is built on the principles enshrined in the work historically carried out by the Socialist Alliance. </p>
