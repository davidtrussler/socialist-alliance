lang="EN-US" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><i>Clive Heemskerk</i></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> (SP) reported that the TUSC Steering Committee had met twice since the previous LULC Meeting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Thirty eight candidates had now been endorsed, including eight from Scotland, and six more were pending.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The candidates included 4 UNISON Branch Secretaries; 5 UNISON Branch Officers; 2 RMT and 1 ASLEF Branch Officer; I UNITE Convenor and 4 former Labour councilors/Prospective Parliamentary Candidates.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Parties represented included the SP, SWP, SR, Lanarkshire SA and Solidarity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Two candidates had been rejected.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>One was because the local RMT branch had not been sure whether to endorse, but the individual subsequently appealed to the Branch which then agreed to approve, and the Steering Committee also agreed to endorse.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The other had wanted to stand against a RMT sponsored Labour MP, and this would not be acceptable to the RMT members of the Steering Committee.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>He explained every member of the Steering Committee had the right of veto, and went on to outline how the RMT were now coming on board with Branches applying to the RMT Executive, and 13 RMT Branches have now backed TUSC.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This has encouraged political debate within the RMT between Labour and TUSC.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>He concluded by explaining that he felt the project was a modest step forward, especially by raising the arguments about the need for working class political representation, and this despite leading trade union figures only being involved in an individual capacity &#8211; but each one is part of, and a leader of, a mass working class organization.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>In answer to a question from <i>Toby Abse</i></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">, he confirmed London Underground RMT had backed Jill Mountford (AWL) in Peckham.</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">The following general points were made in the discussion</span></p>  <ul style="margin-top:0cm" type="square">  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">The veto allowed on the   Steering Committee is undemocratic &#8211; there should be majority voting</span></li>  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">The veto reflects the   fact this is a Coalition, not a Party</span></li>  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">The AWL has not applied   for TUSC endorsement of its candidate</span></li>  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">The Coalition is bound to   throw up problems and issues</span></li>  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Labour right wingers   should be opposed even if sponsored by a Trade Union</span></li>  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">The RMT veto is wrong,   and the Steering Committee should address its lack of democracy</span></li>  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">TUSC should be inclusive   and allow Supporting Organisations onto the Steering Committee as was   originally envisaged</span></li>  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">With TUSC unlikely to   contest more than 50 seats out of 650, we should not be concerned at   whether or not we oppose trade union sponsored candidates at this   stage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Building TUSC for   developments after the General election is more important</span></li>  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">TUSC is an interaction   between the trade union and socialist movement led by the SP</span></li>  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Our aims for the General   election should be ambitious but achievable, establishing the left as a   champion of democracy and working class political representation and into   one united organization which was part of the labour movement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>TUSC is the only vehicle for such   a project.</span></li>  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Those not supporting TUSC   have fallen away from the LULC</span></li>  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">We need to build on the   ground for what will be needed after the Election which will be savage   cuts, anti trade union initiatives and attacks on civil liberties</span></li>  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">The lack of democracy   within TUSC will make it difficult for TUSC to champion democracy</span></li>  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Giving trade union   bureaucrats a blank cheque is a dangerous road to go down</span></li>  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Defence of trade unions   is the key issue. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>We should   ask all candidates where they stand on the anti trade union laws</span></li>  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">It was disappointing that   left organizations like CPGB had not received candidate endorsement</span></li>  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">We need as many TUSC   candidates as possible</span></li> </ul>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">In addition, specific points were raised, as follows:</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><i>Steve Freeman</i></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> (RDG) wanted a TUSC branch and candidate in Peckham, Southwark.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>He argued there were not enough resources in Sothwark to stand in more than one seat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><i>Toby Abse</i></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> (SA) pointed out that the AWL&apos;s Jill Mountford was already standing in Peckham and that Southwark had two other constituencies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>He also hoped London would have more than 4 TUSC candidates, and he asked that we promote the &apos;Defend the Welfare State&apos; demonstration on April 10.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><i>Peter Manson</i></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> (CPGB) wanted to know why their 3 candidates had not been endorsed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>They had wanted to be open and avoid clashes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The CPGB had opposed No2EU because it did not include demands for open borders or republican democracy, including the right to bear arms, but these were not conditions for the General Election</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">In his reply, <i>Clive Heemskerk</i></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> explained that the SP was concentrating on Lewisham and thus not Southwark.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>He suggested Steve Freeman do the groundwork for a TUSC candidate in Southwark.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>He accepted the slowness of the process had been frustrating.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Time constraints had prevented detailed discussions at Steering Committee meetings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>However, a Coalition had been formed for a limited purpose which enabled RMT branches and socialist organizations to put forward candidates.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>TUSC candidates had to be accountable to TUSC.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>In the CPGB&apos;s case, they had not specified which seats and candidates they wanted to be endorsed, simply asking for three unnamed candidates to be endorsed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>In the European elections, the CPGB&apos;s decision to support Labour and not No2EU was based on the refusal by Lead No 2EU candidates to commit to supporting a workers&apos; militia &#8211; this did not help their cause.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Also, the CPGB had not answered the questions around &apos;social weight&apos;.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Regarding Liverpool, which had been raised by the tUSP delegate to the meeting, Pete Glover had stood before and was the SP&apos;s nominated candidate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">There was further discussion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span><i>Pete McLaren</i></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> could see why TUSC had concerns about an organization who felt it crucial in any election that a Coalition supported workers&apos; militia, but on the other hand he had hoped TUSC would have been more open and inclusive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The CPGB needs to be more serious about where it intends to stand, and he hoped the SP could move on from No2EU and those who had opposed it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>It was crucial that we build on both No2EU and TUSC immediately after the General Election, and that we do so in an inclusive and non sectarian way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span><i>Terry Pearce </i></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">(CNWP) agreed TUSC was a step forward and argued we should all work to make TUSC more effective.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>We should relate to all anti cuts initiatives.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span><i>Peter Manson</i></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> asked that if the CPGB came back with specific constituencies, would that then be considered by the TUSC Steering Committee, or would lack of social weight be more important?</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><i>Clive Heemskerk</i></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> replied to the discussion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>He outlined how there had been more discussion within the RMT than had been the case with No2EU.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>He reminded organizations TUSC was a temporary coalition, not a perfectly formed party.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>He re-iterated his concerns that the CPGB had not answered the social weight questions, and suggested they obtain RMT branch support for constituencies they wished to contest before coming back to the Steering Committee.</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><b>It was agreed to call a further meeting of the LULC as soon as possible after the General Election to reflect on it and decide where we
