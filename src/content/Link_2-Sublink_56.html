unions to build a concerted political and industrial response to the election
results, especially the BNP’s success and, in a No2EU Supporters Bulletin on
June 8, he had called for urgent discussions following the election of two
fascists, adding that the 150,000 votes gave us a solid platform to build
on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>We need urgent discussions

the LRC that any left platform should also consider endorsing socialist Green

again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>We should also build on the
electoral co-ordinating work of the SGUC, but trade union support was also
needed although he argued socialists should take the lead as trade unions were
not organised as a political party and their support did not always
materialise.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>In Scotland some TU
officials were discussing using the Peoples Charter to measure candidates
against – this could include SSP, solidarity, the SNP, Greens and Labour
