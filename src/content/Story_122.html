			<h1>July 2014: TUSC starts to prepare for the General Election – and seeks discussions with Left Unity, reports ISN delegate Pete McLaren</h1>
			<p></p><p><b><span>REPORT FROM TUSC STEERING COMMITTEE 02/07/14</span></b></p><p><span>In attendance</span>: <span>Paula Mitchell (SP); Charlie Kimber
(SWP); Mike Seargant (RMT); Pete McLaren (ISN); John McInally (PCS Vice-Pres);
Dave Nellist (Chair); Clive Heemskerk (Agent)</span></p><p><span> </span><b><span>LEICESTER COUNCILLORS      </span></b></p><p><span>It was agreed
Clive Heemskerk would attend a meeting of the Leicester TUSC SC to discuss how
best to support the two ‘rebel’ councillors who now sat as TUSC councillors</span></p><p><span><span> </span></span><b><span>SOCIALIST RESISTANCE         </span></b><span>      </span></p><p><span>Their
letter of resignation from the TUSC SC had been circulated.<span> </span>Its reasons were the emergence of Left Unity
which SR felt was broad based, socialist and democratic, unlike TUSC with its
federal structure and lack of individual membership. It recognised the ISN had
been set up to represent individuals, but felt that independents would get no
representation if they didn’t agree with ISN policies.<span> </span>SR also expressed concerns about the policy
of TUSC standing as widely as possible.<span> </span></span></p><p><span>These
arguments were countered at the meeting.<span> 
</span>TUSC branches were now developing, and the federal/consensus position
meant no one organisation could use its numerical superiority to dominate.<span> </span></span><b><span>It was
agreed</span></b><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Georgia"> to respond expressing the SC’s disappointment with the
decision and the reasoning given</span></p><p><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;

RMT, that there had been a recent unanimous RMT Conference decision to continue
fully backing TUSC</span></b></p><p><span> </span><b><span>PREPARATIONS FOR THE 2015 GENERAL ELECTION        </span></b></p><p><b><span>Proposal for a National Election
Fund</span></b><span><span>              </span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:Georgia">There was a lengthy discussion about whether or not this
should fund the deposits of the 89 General Election candidates needed for the
media threshold, and whether or not TUSC should aim for at least that number
and a corresponding number of Council candidates, especially in those 89
constituencies – 1,015 candidates in total. <span> </span>It was felt PPC’s needed to provide additional
information, including local campaigning and how they would raise additional
funds towards the £1,500 needed per constituency for printing and free post
delivery.<span> </span>It was generally thought
having such a fund would help build momentum for both the General and Council
elections.<span> </span>National donors would be
likely to respond to a national appeal.<span> 
</span>The RMT expressed enthusiasm for supporting locally funded candidates
whilst accepting the need for national funding.<span> 
</span>The SP reported growing enthusiasm for mounting a strong General
Election campaign.<span> </span>There had already
been 10 meetings in London since May 22, with local TUSC groups emerging in a
number of areas including Enfield, Barking &amp; Dagenham and Bromley.<span> </span>We should consider requesting PPC nominations
from TUSC groups, Paula Mitchell added.<span> 
</span>The RMT reported TUSC groups were being set up in Kent.<span> </span></span></p><p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

suggest that TUSC’s preferred position </span><span>would be for LU to become a participating organisation in
the TUSC coalition, on the same basis as the existing constituent
organisations, with SC representation. LU
would still be able to produce its own material in election campaigns; stand
candidates, under its registered electoral name – but stating they are part of
the TUSC campaign, for example, for negotiating purposes with the broadcasting
authorities; and generally be responsible for its candidates’ campaigns,
subject to candidates endorsing agreed TUSC core policy statements. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm;

the way that TUSC functions.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm;
