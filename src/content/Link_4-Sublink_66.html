<p class="MsoNormal"><b>BACKGROUND</b></p>

<ul style="margin-top:0cm" type="square">
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt">The
   idea to invite all local community/socialist/progressive organisations
   which contested elections in their locality, along with national left
   organisations that see the need for a left alternative to Labour, came
   from Nick Long, one of the organisers of one such local group, Lewisham
   People Before Profit</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt">Nick
   Long met with Pete McLaren, who he had known since his days in the
   Socialist Alliance, to help him organise this national meeting in Rugby</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt">The
   meeting was subsequently booked to be held at Rugby’s Utd Railwaymens Club
   on July 24th<span style="mso-tab-count:1">         </span></li>
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt">The
   Meeting was endorsed by the Alliance for Green Socialism, the Rugby Red
   Green Alliance, the Left Liaison Committee, the Wellingborough Socialists,
   the Socialist Alliance, the Barrow Socialist Peoples Party and Lewisham
   People before Profit – even before the Invite Letter was sent.</li>
</ul>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>INVITATIONS TO ATTEND</b></p>

<ul style="margin-top:0cm" type="square">

</ul>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>AIMS OF THE MEETING</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The Invite Letter made it clear that the aims of the Meeting
were as follows:</p>

<ul style="margin-top:0cm" type="square">
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l3 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list 36.0pt">To
   share good practice </li>
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l3 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list 36.0pt">Network
   with each other and discuss the establishment of a national network body
   of regional and local parties with a representative from each affiliated
   organisation. A suggested working title was the National Network of
   Progressive and Socialist Parties (NNPSP). </li>
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l3 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list 36.0pt">Feed
   into any discussions on the formation of a new party of the left. </li>
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l3 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list 36.0pt">It
   was suggested that tasks that the national network body could seek to
   undertake could be to establish a web site, disseminate literature and
   campaign information, investigate the possibly of a <span style="color:black">quarterly</span> journal, organise an annual
   conference, help organise regional conferences, direct supporters to help
   out in by-elections, and represent nationally affiliated members.</li>
</ul>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>CONDUCT OF THE MEETING </b></p>

<ul style="margin-top:0cm" type="square">
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo4;tab-stops:list 36.0pt">It
   was suggested that the conduct of the meeting would be by consensus, but,
   should the conference decide to vote on an issue, each registered
   political party would have one vote each. </li>
</ul>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>ORGANISATIONAL MATTERS </b></p>

<ul style="margin-top:0cm" type="square">
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo4;tab-stops:list 36.0pt">A
   registration fee of £10 per organisation, and a £2 observer fee, have been
   suggested. </li>
</ul>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
