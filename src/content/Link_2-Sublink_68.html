and where we go from here</b></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none; text-autospace:none"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><i>Pete McLaren</i></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> (SA) opened the discussion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>He referred to the Left results as circulated, but began by outlining the national trends as he saw them. </span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Times">There was a national swing to the Tories of 5%, but that was not evenly distributed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Labour did better in its traditional urban areas, regaining control of a number of Councils.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The BNP failed to make the Parliamentary breakthrough they had threatened, and they lost a large number of Councilors, including all in Barking.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Their % vote increased by 1.8% overall, however, and they obtained 564,321 votes &#8211; 1.9%.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>UKIP&apos;s vote, 914,154, was 3%, up by 0.9%.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Despite winning their first ever MP, and we should congratulate Caroline Lucas he argued, the Green Party vote fell to 0.96%, a decrease of 0.08%.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Labour Left candidates had mixed results &#8211; 5 out of 22 increased their total vote, others lost out</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none; text-autospace:none"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Times">He went on to outline his concern that 18 different left organizations had stood 121 candidates between them, gaining 55,596 votes, an average of 1.5%.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Twelve Left independents also stood, gaining 10,174 votes &#8211; an average of 2.2%.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>This gave an overall total Left vote of 65,770, an average of 1.6%.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>This was no worse &#8211; or better &#8211; than 2001 (Socialist Alliance) or 2005 (SP) but, with the recession, high unemployment, public spending and benefits cuts, Iraq and Afghanistan, this is a decrease from previous elections he felt the Left should have done better, and had not been helped by the lack of unity evident in the high number of different campaigns.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>This could be compared with the results obtained by 29 LRC supported Left Labour candidates &#8211; 458,000 votes, averaging 34.8% &#8211; 15,800 votes per candidate on average.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>In terms of left unity he wondered whether the Â£64,000 lost by loosing deposits could not have been somewhat better spent, although he understood why the Left wanted to use the higher political climate elections created.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>He went out to outline the view being increasingly put forward that the Left should seriously consider re-joining Labour and re-claiming it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The LRC view was that the working class always tend to support the Labour Party, as they did in 2010 &#8211; especially as there is no viable alternative<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The Labour party changes through time, and it can be transformed again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The mass of trade unions are affiliated to and finance the Labour Party.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>It is the working class that will change society, not small left groups &#8211; we need to work within the working class and its organizations.</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none; text-autospace:none"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Times">He concluded by giving his own view.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>There needs to be a working class response to the Crisis, particularly the Public Spending cuts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The Left needs to unite and help organise the resistance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>That response will be better co-ordinated if it is part of a movement to build a new Left umbrella organization or Party.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Trade Unions may be more likely to take a new Left party seriously than a campaign or coalition for one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We need a timescale for a new Left Party otherwise we will not move forward, and the LRC type view would gain further credence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>What we do create must be inclusive and democratic &#8211; No2EU and TUSC far from perfect on both, he felt</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">In the discussion, <i>Terry Pierce</i></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> (CNWP) argued that people felt betrayed by Labour, but were fearful of the Tories.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The Left vote was poor as voters returned to Labour.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>He disagreed with deadlines for a new Party &#8211; it would come out of the struggles we are about to see.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We must get involved in the anti-cuts campaigns, and candidates would evolve from that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He accepted there may be some movement back into the Labour Party, and that we could never write it off &#8211; but it was not worth rejoining now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>We need to build left unity to defend the Welfare State, and there should be a re-call meeting of the CNWP to organize work within communities and trade unions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span><i>Daniel Randall</i></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> (AWL) argued we should not be celebrating the success of Caroline Lucas against a left working class Labour candidate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>In terms of the Labour Party, 10,000 had joined it since May 6th.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>John McDonnell would be running for the leadership, which would bolster left trade unionists, most of whom were affiliated to Labour.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The Left cannot ignore that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>He asked where TUSC was going &#8211; would there be a Conference?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><i>Dave Church</i></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> (DLP) agreed with much of Pete McLaren&apos;s analysis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Politics operated around elections, and we need to take them seriously.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>However, there were too many Left organizations standing separately, none large enough to attract media attention.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>This meant the cuts were being seen as inevitable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The Left was wasting its time at present &#8211; we needed another â€˜Socialist Alliance&apos; type organization as groups were not ready to give up their own identity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The new organization should have a federal structure and not allow one group to dominate &#8211; all within 12/18 months.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>This would enable the media to obtain a left view on events.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Single issue campaigns, like those opposing cuts, were important but had no permanence and were unlikely to lead to anything.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span><i>Steve Ballard</i></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> (tUSP) argued we should be talking about the crisis of capitalism.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>We need to regain control of the means of production &#8211; the Left did not seem to realize that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span><i>Toby Abse</i></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> (SA) argued Caroline Lucas was a genuine socialist, and would be used as a left voice by the media.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>On the Labour Party, he felt there was no case in principle for re-entry, and John McDonnell would not get enough support to get on the ballot paper, but individuals may wish to re-join.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>In the General Election, the working class had moved back to Labour to stop the Tories, but were unlikely to join the Party &#8211; most were not in trade unions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The Left needs to give a lead against the horrendous cuts, and the working class needed representation &#8211; we need a united organization/alliance/party &#8211; an umbrella which must be open inclusive and broad.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span><i>Marcus Seal</i></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> (WP) suggested that those who opposed capitalism had voted Labour rather than a ramshackle coalition formed at the last minute.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Workers Power wanted a new workers party soon or otherwise the window of opportunity would close and the LRC argument would become more credible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>We need to be part of local and national struggles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span><i>Clive Heemskerk</i></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> (SP) started by saying the General Election may not change the character of the Labour Party.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Despite the working class partly returning to Labour, it was the worse Labour result since 1983.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Labour has lost 5 million voters since 1997. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Labour should be viewed not only by its vote, but also by how it is seen and its structures.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>John McDonnell should call for the re-instatement of expelled socialists and the re-introduction of Clause 4 &#8211; if that happened, we should consider it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the Election, some SP votes went up, but loyalty to Labour was too strong.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>TUSC was a modest attempt at providing working class political representation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>More RMT branches had supported TUSC than No2EU.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Lack of media coverage had been a major obstacle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>It had already been agreed informally to continue with TUSC.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There would be a national meeting of all TUSC candidates and representatives of local campaigns.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There was no enthusiasm for a revamped â€œSocialist Allianceâ€ or detailed structures.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Social weight remained important.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>We needed to pull significant figures from the trade union movement into TUSC so that they could then help convince their rank and file.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This was better than simply bolting the left together.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span><i>Dave Church</i></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> asked if the CNWP would have a role in all this.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>He explained that whilst the SP was negotiating with trade union leaders, the rest of us wanted to know what was happening.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He also wondered when campaigning could become a Party, and wondered why social weight had to dictate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span><i>Terry Pearce</i></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> was concerned that the CNWP seemed to have been shelved and it could have developed much more.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span><i>Clive Heemskerk</i></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> responded.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>He reminded the meeting that the Labour Party arose out of campaigns; it was a coalition of organizations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>A timetable cannot be set against the tide of events.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>A mass Party could have been launched out of the anti war movement, but wasn&apos;t.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>More could have been done to build on the anti poll tax campaign.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>At present, he was not sure how TUSC and the CNWP would develop.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>A new party could not be artificially set up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span><i>Pete McLaren</i></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> felt we need to act sooner rather than later as the far right would not remain disorganised.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>More importantly, local campaigns needed national and regional co-ordination.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>He was pleased we were having an open discussion on the Left.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>He felt that TUSC, averaging less than 1% of the vote, had not reached out to the working class, but, as with No2EU, a start had been made.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He hoped TUSC would now be opened out to all supporting organizations. <i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Steve Ballard </i></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">suggested we needed to draw together what we could do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He wondered whether TUSC could become a fully democratic organization.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span><i>Terry Pearce</i></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> agreed local community campaigns needed national co-ordination.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He hoped the CNWP, in conjunction with the NSSN, could do that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>TUSC was too top down and exclusive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>We need to build a movement to challenge capitalism.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span><i>Clive Heemskerk</i></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> reminded delegates there would be a TUSC national meeting/conference for those involved in the TUSC campaigns, but could give no more detail because the Steering Committee had not met since the Elections.</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><b>NEXT MEETING</b></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">It was agreed the LULC should meet to discuss a strategy for the coming struggles and how they could be linked &#8211;
