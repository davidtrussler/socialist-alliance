We must avoid excluding minorities</li>  <li>TUSC  must develop its policy on women and reflect womenâ€™sâ€™ concerns.<span> </span>Meetings for women should be  organised</li> </ul>  <p><b>TUSC AND DEMOCRACY </b></p>  <ul>  <li>Does  TUSC have any democratic structures?<span>   </span>Why has there been no open Conference?</li>  <li>Could  the ISN have two representatives on the TUSC Steering Committee (SC) to  represent different interests?</li>  <li>Members  of the TUSC Steering Committee are wary of moving too fast because of past  mistakes with other left projects</li>  <li>The  TUSC Steering Committee is federal with decisions by consensus only</li>  <li>The  Steering Committee has met since July to discuss the London elections: it  has not yet addressed the issues raised at the July Conference</li>  <li>Although  we need a new Party, calling for one now may threaten the future of TUSC  because it could threaten the existence of existing supportive parties</li>  <li>The  July TUSC Conference broadened out the SC and thus improved democracy  within TUSC.<span> </span>Not only has  representation of independents been accepted, but it has been agreed to  find ways of giving representation to supportive political groups, local  TU branches and local TUSC branches</li>  <li>TUSC  has a very underdeveloped programme which must be changed: the question  is, how?</li> </ul>  <p><span> </span></p>  <p><span><b>WHAT CAN THE ISN DO TO BUILD TUSC AND ITSELF, AND HOW SHOULD THE ISN BE ORGANISED?</b></span></p>  <p><i>Nick Wrack</i><span> explained the present TUSC programme was limited to what the different groups involved in TUSC could agree on to stand candidates together.<span style=\\"mso-spacerun: yes\\"> </span>The ISN could raise additional policies for consideration.<span> </span>Those present suggested the following ways of building TUSC and the ISN:</span></p>  <ul>  <li>We  must intervene wherever we can and be seen to have a national presence as  the ISN , eg on N30.<span> </span>To do  this we need local contacts on the ground, and then to set up  networking/mapping arrangements</li>  <li>We  need a common script â€“ the need for a new workersâ€™ party should be part of  it</li>  <li>We  should work to set up local TUSC branches, out of Anti Cuts Groups where  appropriate, and then use such branches to encourage local membership</li>  <li>Local  TUSC branches must be recognised by the SC</li>  <li>Independents  should try to build local TUSC branches</li>  <li>It  may prove more difficult to set up branches in areas dominated by the SP  or SWP</li>  <li>As  we build TUSC, we build the ISN, but not by acting against existing  socialist groups</li>  <li>We  must use the ISN web site to get branches and independents together</li>  <li>We  must not underestimate our potential influence </li>  <li>TUSC  branches should promote TUSC on N30 </li>  <li>The  â€˜Unique Selling Pointâ€™ of the ISN is the arguing for the creation of a new  socialist party</li> </ul>  <p><span> </span></p>  <p><span><b>THE FOLLOWING ORGANISATIONAL POINTS FOR THE ISN WERE AGREED</b></span></p>  <p class=\\"MsoNormal\\" style=\\"margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:18.0pt;mso-list:l0 level2 lfo2;
