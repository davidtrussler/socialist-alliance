		<h1>National Shop stewards Network agrees to launch an &quot;anti-cuts campaign, bringing trade unions and communities together to save all jobs and services&quot;</h1>

		<p>  </p><p><b>REPORT FROM THE NSSN CONFERENCE 22/01/11</b></p>  <p>Nearly 600 people met on Saturday 22 January for the special anti-cuts conference of the National Shop Stewards Network (NSSN).<span> </span><span>Motion one&apos;, from a majority of the NSSN steering committee, proposed that the NSSN launches an &quot;anti-cuts campaign, bringing trade unions and communities together to save all jobs and services&quot;.</span></p>  <p>Motion &apos;two&apos;, from a minority of the steering committee, proposed that the NSSN should not launch an anti-cuts campaign, and instead should &quot;do everything constructive, through discussions with Coalition of Resistance, Right to Work and other groups, to build and launch a single national anti-cuts organisation early in 2011&quot; (see appendix for the two motions). <b>Two NSSN officers chaired the discussion, one from each side of the debate.</b></p>  <p>In the vote after the debate, 305 trade union branch and workplace representatives voted for motion one, against 89 for motion two (NB: nearly 200 observers and anti-cuts campaign representatives also attended the conference but were not part of this vote, to respect the democratic structure of the NSSN).<span><span><span> </span>Those supporting Motion 1, the majority position, included the following points:</span></span></p>  <ul>  <li><span>Labour  councils should refuse to pass on government cuts, as Liverpool and  Lambeth councils did in the 1980s.</span></li>  <li><span>The NSSN was  set up a long time before Right to Work (RtW) and Coalition of Resistance  (CoR)</span></li>  <li><span>Some of the  supporters of Motion 2 accept the need for some cuts</span></li>  <li><span><span>Trade unions  are weaker today than in the 1980s, so the NSSN&apos;s key task is to establish  the base for trade union resistance to the cuts.</span></span></li>  <li><span>The role of  the NSSN is to continue to build workers&apos; solidarity and the shop  stewards&apos; movement.</span></li>  <li><span>We can not  stop all the cuts</span></li>  <li><span>The NSSN can  not set itself up as the leadership of the campaign against the cuts</span></li> </ul>  <p><b> </b></p>  <p>There were 30 contributions altogether in the debate, 15 for motion one and 15 for motion two. </p>  <p> </p>  <p><b>Appendix:</b></p>  <p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>§<span><span>§<span><span>§<span><span>§<span><span>§<span><span> </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>  <p><span><span><span><span>Whilst Conference should allow time for a full and necessary debate concerning trade union bodies supporting anti-cuts candidates in 2011 elections, the NSSN will leave decisions as to whether to stand such candidates to our local and national affiliates.</span></span></span></span></p>  <p><span><span>  </span><span>  </span><span>  </span><span>  </span><span>  </span><span>  </span><span>  </span></span><span><span>  </span><span>  </span><span>  </span></span><span><i>Pete McLaren 24/01/11</i></span><span></span></p>     <p></p>
