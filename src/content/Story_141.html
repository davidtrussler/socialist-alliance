		<h1>MOTION TO THE 2020 AGM from Pete McLaren, agreed unanimously</h1>
		
		<p>The Socialist Alliance reiterates the political position it adopted at the 2019 AGM to continue the broad political direction adopted at the 2014, 2016 and 2018 AGMs.</p>

		<p>The Socialist Alliance notes that<p>

		<ul>
			<li>We are in the middle of an international pandemic.  There have been well over 60,000 deaths from COVID 19 in the UK alone since March 2020.  A considerable number of those deaths could have been avoided if there been no NHS cuts, sufficient supplies of PPE, an earlier lockdown and a working system of test, track and trace from the start</li>
			<li>Brexit is going ahead, with or without a deal</li>
			<li>Labour heavily lost the 2019 General Election.  This was extremely demoralising and disorientating especially for those who joined Labour because of Jeremy Corbynâ€™s leadership</li>
			<li>Sir Kier Starmer has replaced Jeremy Corbyn as leader of the Labour Party and has already moved the Party to the right, with suspensions and expulsions used to stifle criticism and opposition</li>
			<li>Increasing numbers of socialists are leaving the Labour Party, many looking to see what is available elsewhere</li>
			<li>TUSC has agreed to renew electoral activity, with a broader Steering Committee and plans for much greater local and individual involvement</li>
			<li>Left Unity continues to provide an alternative political voice on a number of issues</li>
		</ul>

		<p>As a result</p>

		<ul>
			<li>This all gives a new dynamic for the Socialist Alliance to continue to see its small role as being to encourage and facilitate left forces to continue to work together in practice on the ground and to continue to argue for a socialist party uniting genuine socialist forces currently inside and outside the Labour Party.</li>
			<li>In fact, in the quickly changing political circumstances of today, members of the SA have an even greater role to play in terms of attempting to unite the left and avoid the right or far right filling the vacuum created by the complete breakdown in trust for establishment politicians</li>
			<li>This unity will continue to be the unity of left class struggle and anti-austerity forces, whether inside or outside the Labour Party. The SA rejects the idea that we should refrain from criticising or opposing Labour MPs or Labour councils who impose cuts or other anti-working class measures</li>
		</ul>

		<p>In practical terms, the SA </p>

		<ul>
			<li>Agrees to donate towards the anti-austerity local election campaigns of any anti-austerity candidates who have been a member of the SA at any time since its re-launch in 2004/5</li>
			<li>Will continue to pay for the PO Box, and will continue to pay for the printing of socialist and labour movement groups as at present</li>
		</ul>
