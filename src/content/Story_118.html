			<h1>SA NEC discusses its attitude to Left Unity and developments within TUSC</h1>
			<p></p><p>

</p><p><span><b>REPORT FROM SA NEC SUN JUNE 9th</b></span></p>

<p><span>After <span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"> </span>hearing reports about finance, the SA web site, and from the
Alliance for Green Socialism, the meeting moved on to the main discussion:<span> </span>TUSC ISN, TUSC National Steering
Committee, and the emergence of Left Unity – and how the SA should relate to
these developments.</span></p>

<p><span> </span></p>

<p><span>Pete McLaren reported that the Steering
Committee had fully discussed the recent Council elections where</span></p>

<ul>
 <li><span>120 TUSC candidates had
   stood in 20 Councils – 5% of the seats available, an increase on 2012.<span> </span>TUSC averaged 2.5% this year</span></li>
 <li><span>In Rugby, TUSC averaged
   2.9%, with a number of candidates in the ‘top 25’of TUSC results
   nationally.<span> </span>County Council
   elections, being in largely rural areas, were not traditionally good
   terrain for socialists</span></li>
 <li><span>UKIP had done well
   locally and nationally, being seen as a party of protest which was of
   concern to us</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span>He
went on to outline the lengthy discussions the TUSC SC had held about Left
Unity, welcoming it and asking for talks about collaboration.<span> </span>There here had also been discussions
about the 2014 Euro Elections ahead of the meeting called by the RMT for June
10 with all five TUSC partners, the CPB and AGS.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"> </span>There had been a general feeling that, if we stand, it must
be on a socialist basis an in opposition to UKIP.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"> </span>Capitalism must be blamed for the crisis, not
immigrants.<span> </span>It appeared the
majority view was for withdrawal from the capitalist EU on a socialist
basis.<span> </span>It was hoped TUSC would be
the umbrella for both Euro and Council elections in 2014.<span> </span>Organisationally, he had been elected
TUSC’s Local Group Development Officer</span></p>

<p><span>He
described how Left Unity had developed since March, and reported from its first
national meeting where he felt the positives had outweighed the negatives –
there was a unanimous desire for a new, open and democratic left party, to be
launched in November, but there was also a lot of bourgeois ‘wooly’ thinking,
and a significant minority were hostile to left groups.</span></p>

<p><span>He
outlined how the ISN had decided to engage fully with Left Unity (LU) whilst
remaining an active component of TUSC, and had agreed to help form a socialist
platform within LU.<span>  </span>He
suggested the SA retained a structure to enable it to intervene in the ISN and
LU whilst keeping the registered SA electoral title and web site.</span></p>

<p><span>The
following were amongst points made during a lengthy discussion:</span></p>

<ul>
 <li><span>The left has mostly,
   historically, been opposed to the EU</span></li>
 <li><span>LU has registered ‘Left
   Party’, perhaps initially to stand in the Euro elections</span></li>
 <li><span>Local LU groups varied in
   size, many meetings being small, but they did include new faces</span></li>
 <li><span>Not that many of the
   8,000 who had signed up to LU had attended local LU meetings</span></li>
 <li><span>It was not clear whether
   LU would adopt socialist or social democratic policies</span></li>
 <li><span>LU is already committed
   to OMOV, and now needs to find a way of involving left groups</span></li>
 <li><span>It would be premature to
   suggest merging the SA into the ISN and/or LU, but we could agree to do so
   further down the line, becoming a faction within both</span></li>
 <li><span>Standing in the EU
   elections has the danger of pandering to the UKIP vote</span></li>
 <li><span>Many workers still
   support the Labour view that they can do little to oppose the cuts – we
   must counter that view</span></li>
 <li><span>The SA needs to retain
   its electoral title and web site – one annual meeting could achieve that</span></li>
 <li><span>TUSC may claim to be
   developing branches, but in reality it is the SP with another hat</span></li>
 <li><span>LU needs to consider
   affiliations from trade union branches, community and tenants groups</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><b>Following
the discussion, it was agreed to recommend to the 2013 AGM that, for the next
period whilst we assess developments, the SA meets annually with an AGM and NEC
meeting consecutively on the same day as a ‘holding operation’, with email
discussion in-between.<span> </span>Pete
McLaren to draft the appropriate constitutional amendment.<span> </span>The 2013 AGM was agreed for Sunday
December 15th, after the LU November Conference to asses its
decisions alongside TUSC developments, 3pm at the Lucas Arms </b></span></p>
