The Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition should continue in existence after the 2010 general election, remaining registered with the Electoral Commission and maintaining a structure that enables it to fulfil its core task.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>This is, essentially, to provide an opportunity for local groups of trade unionists, community campaigners and socialist organisations who want to stand candidates in elections to appear on the ballot paper, if they so wish, as part of a wider challenge &#8211;

organisation, participating organisations will continue to be able to produce their own supporting material, subject to electoral law, as was the practise successfully adopted in the general election campaign, which allowed different organisations and local campaigns to collaborate under a common banner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:4.0pt"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;
