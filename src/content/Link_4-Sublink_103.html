<p>He went on to outline the extent to which we had implemented
those policies<span><b> </b></span><span></span></p>

   SA has continued to co-ordinate the LULC, which has continued to meet and
   discuss issues of common interest to different left groups.<span> </span>However, attendance at meetings

   job not many other organisations could do.</li>

   tab-stops:list 72.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">One
   of our members has recently been elected to be one of two such

   national left organisations – and that includes SA members.<span> </span><span style="font-size:14.0pt;

 <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination:none;mso-list:l0 level2 lfo4;

   ISN, composed largely of SA members past and present, seems like an
   embryonic socialist alliance with its commitment to a new workers’ party
   and an expressed determination to continue developing whatever happens to
   its parent body, TUSC<span><b></b></span></li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none">There has been limited progress however in terms of unity
on the left, he continued.<span> </span>There
are now four national projects claiming leadership of the anti cuts movement -
the National Shop Stewards Network, Right to Work, Coalition of Resistance,
and, recently, Unite the Resistance, ostensibly set up by the SWP to build for
N30.<span> </span>TUSC provides a further, but
starkly different alternative – an anti cuts body with local and national
structures which offers a political voice to the anti cuts movement by standing
anti cuts election candidates</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none">In terms of broader left unity, the Left Unity Liaison
Committee has stuttered almost to a halt. We have been asked to find out why so
many groups no longer regularly attend. Because of the development of TUSC, the
CNWP has only met once this year, and the results of that meeting were
inconclusive.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none"><span><b> </b></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none"><span>In conclusion, he argued,
the Socialist Alliance remains a small organization at national level with a
dedicated number of activists.<span> </span>It
continues to have an influence on the left, partly because of the work of our
members, but largely because of its background, tradition and, in particular,
the commitment to socialist unity as part of the process in building a new Left
Party.<span> </span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none"><span><b>This constitutes the
unique position of the SA</b></span><span> – no other
left political group shears that determination for unity, let alone the long
history of working tirelessly to achieve it.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"> </span>Former members continue to show that determination along
with many of the other principles the SA enshrines as witnessed at the recent launch
meeting of the TUSC Independent Socialist Network.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"> </span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none"><span> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none"><span>There will come a time in
the coming period, he added, when we will have to decide whether we should
remain as an organization of individual socialists, or whether we should merge
ourselves as a faction into something more viable long term that sits with
enough of our principles.<span> </span>That
could be TUSC, or what, if anything, comes out of TUSC, or it could be TUSC’s
Independent Socialist Network (ISN).<span> 
</span>Events will dictate what will become the best option for the SA.<span> </span>He felt both TUSC and the ISN were,
potentially, exciting developments</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none"><span> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none"><span>In the meantime, the SA
must continue to move forward with realistic goals and an organization that
enables it to continue to function.<span> 
</span>SA members must remain active in their trade unions and their
localities, continuing to encourage non-sectarian, open and democratic ways of
working.<span> </span>The SA itself can, as an
organization, influence left political projects as they develop.<span> </span>Our commitment to left unity at every
level can continue to have a healthy effect on developments on the left.<span> </span>This may mean hanging in there until
developments elsewhere move the party project forward – a sort of holding
position.<span> </span>We are not new to that
position, and we have managed to achieve it so far in a number of ways.<span>  </span>He remained confident that the
SA, as presently constituted, and with a bit of tweaking here and there, could
remain a positive influence on left politics whilst it determines whether its
longer term future lies within a larger organization committed to its long held
desire for a new Left Party rooted within the working class which is
unashamedly socialist, democratic, open, non-sectarian and united.</span></p>

<p><b>b) Chair </b></p>

<p>Gerry Byrne began by explaining she was not convinced about
TUSC or the ISN, and that therefore she would be abstaining on the
resolution.<span> </span>She was sceptical
about the ISN because of the history of some of its leading personnel, and
because, like TUSC, it was not democratic, transparent or built from the
grassroots.<span> </span>She felt the window of
opportunity for left unity had passed with there being four national anti-cuts
bodies.<span> </span>This was preventing a
united opposition to the Government.<span> 
</span>Public sector action may move things forward.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"> </span>Until then, she thought the role of the SA was limited, just
holding itself together whilst awaiting developments</p>

<p><b>c) Treasurer – FINANCE REPORT</b></p>

<p>Pete McLaren reported a balance of £142.58, compared to
£95.58 twelve months previously.<span> 
</span>Membership income, donations and affiliation income had all dropped
significantly, but so had spending on printing, room hire and, most
significantly, travel to meetings.<span> 
</span>He felt the balance was reasonable given our size.<span> </span>He asked again for a Treasurer to be
elected – it was agreed to ask the NEC to discuss. </p>

<p>The Treasurer’s report was accepted.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none">Pete McLaren moved the resolution on the way the SA should
progress in the coming period.<span> </span>He
began by describing the resolution as an attempt to describe where we are at,
and to set realistic and achievable goals given our size – but goals which give
us a raison d’etre.<span> </span>He listed what
we agreed at the last AGM and set out what progress we had made towards
achieving those goals in terms of promoting unity; influence through elections
in the NSSN and by having a Rugby TUSC candidate; within TUSC – by building
branches and the ISN which was like an embryonic SA committed to a new
socialist party.<span> </span>He then listed
and explained his suggested goals for the next period:</p>
