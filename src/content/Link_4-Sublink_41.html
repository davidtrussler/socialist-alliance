			<div class="panel_left"><h1>SECRETARY’S REPORT TO THE 2009 SA AGM</h1> <h2>INTRODUCTION – A POSITIVE YEAR</h2> <p>Given
what we faced at the last AGM in December 2008, and the size of our
active membership, our political progress since then has been quite
remarkable. Last December, we were faced with a motion which, by
calling for merger, would have effectively closed us down. At the same
time, our ambitions for the Euro Elections in June 2009 were to try and
persuade the rest of the left to help raise enough finances to stand a
‘left list’ in one of the thirteen English regions. </p> <p>The merger
motion was heavily defeated, and within months we were part of the
first ever serious trade union/left co-coordinated challenge to New
Labour, a coalition sponsored by the RMT which stood in every Euro
region in England, Scotland and Wales, and had the only national TV
broadcast to concentrate on undermining the BNP. Two members of the SA,
including the National Secretary, were candidates for
‘No2EU-Yestodemocracy’ as the coalition came to be called. Others
became part of the campaign. The Socialist Alliance was mentioned in
publicity to an audience we could only have dreamt to reach. We have
since agreed to engage with post No2EU developments which are likely to
lead, at the very least, to a trade union/left coalition contesting the
General Election next year. Whilst all this was taking place, we have
continued to co-ordinate what has come to be called the Left Unity
Liaison Committee (LULC), and there have now been 5 meetings in 15
months involving up to 15 different socialist/green socialist
organisations in an attempt to encourage and enable the left to work
more effectively together. At the same time, we have continued our
active involvement in the Campaign for a New Workers’ Party (CNWP)
which has been encouraging supporters to become members to implement
the policy we suggested at the last CNWP national conference. The CNWP
has put most of its energies into No2EU and post No2EU developments,
and there has therefore been limited independent activity, but
campaigning for a new workers’ party has been to the fore of the No2EU
and subsequent developments, and calls for such a party were made at
many Public Meetings and included in publicity. All this has advanced
our main aim of bringing all socialist unity projects together as part
of One Party of the Left based solidly within the working class. </p> <h2>GENERAL ACTIVITIES</h2> <p>The
NEC met 3 times, the minimum laid out in the Constitution. As well as
the AGM, there was a Members Meeting in April to formulate our policy
on No2EU. Much of the discussion at NEC meetings was on socialist
unity. In January, we heard reports of our involvement in the
Convention of the Left, where we had argued, by resolution, for
discussions about how a new left party could be formed. We also tried
to get support for our Euro Election Appeal for funds. Both were
rejected, and we had to put real pressure on the organisers just to
allow these suggestions to be debated. The Convention did however agree
to send a delegate to the LULC, which could prevent further splits. At
the NEC meeting itself in January, we gave critical support to the
Peoples’ Charter, agreed to collate the various charters which were
emerging, decided to continue with the European Election Financial
Appeal, and agreed to try and persuade the AGS to re-join the LULC. The
members meeting, which followed the April NEC, agreed to critically
support No2EU, and to raise the issue of Democracy. In June, the NEC,
after hearing a report from the post No2EU core group, decided to
engage in any post-No2EU developments which broadly fit within our
agreed policies. It heard that the main players within No2EU – the SP,
RMT, CPB and AGS – were meeting in July to discuss their positions, and
that further developments were likely after the summer holiday period.
It was agreed to write to the RMT asking if we could send an SA
representative to subsequent post-No2EU meetings. Attendance at NEC
Meetings was as follows:</p> <p> Toby Abse: NEC Meetings attended (maximum 3) 2; Apologies 1</p> <p> </p> <p>Gerry Byrne: NEC Meetings attended 3; Apologies – </p> <p>Jean Kysow: NEC Meetings attended 3; Apologies – </p> <p>Dave Landau: NEC Meetings attended 3; Apologies – </p> <p>Pete McLaren: NEC Meetings attended 3; Apologies – </p> <p>Liz Peck: NEC Meetings attended 1; Apologies 2 </p> <p>Alliance for Green Socialism: NEC Meetings attended 0; Apologies 0 </p> <p>Coventry And Warwickshire SA: NEC Meetings attended 0; Apologies 1 </p> <p>Revolutionary Democratic Group: NEC Meetings attended 3; Apologies – </p> <p>Rugby Red Green Alliance: NEC Meetings attended 0; Apologies 0 </p> <p>Walsall Democratic Labour Party: NEC Meetings attended 1; Apologies 1 </p> <p>There
has been regular communication with members, both by email and, on a
number of occasions, by post to those members not on email. Members
were kept informed of developments as they took place. Dave Trussler
has continued to maintain and develop the web site. Unfortunately,
through no fault of our own we lost our domain name at the end of July,
and the site was down for two months. This was because our former web
person did not send on the domain renewal notices he received. We have
now bought the domain “www.socialistalliance.org.uk” from the Socialist
Party, and the Site is back up and running with the same information as
before. Membership remains much the same as last year, nationally and
locally. No new local Alliances have emerged, but those already in
existence have continued to meet and promote activity in their
locality. </p> <h2>PRIORITIES FOR THE SA AGREED AT THE 2008 AGM</h2> <p>Only one resolution was passed at the 2008 AGM, and this was our main guide for activity since then. The main points were:</p> <ul> <li>A recognition of the progress made in terms of promoting socialist unity and turning the CNWP into a more effective campaign.</li> <li>Welcoming developments which had led to the formation of a Left Unity Liaison Committee</li> <li>
Agreement that the main priority in the year ahead was to build on
these two developments, and to take forward as far as possible a
campaign for One Party for the Left (ie the socialist movement) based
solidly within the working class</li> </ul> <p>Specifically, the AGM agreed to:</p> <ul> <li>Actively
seek greater positive co-operation within the left and the green left;
and take forward a campaign for One Party for the Left based solidly
within the working class – with the intention that such a party would
have support from trade unions, tenants groups, women, youth, black
groups, anti-war protesters and environmentalists – within the LULC,
the CNWP and the socialist movement generally</li> <li>Attempt to gain the involvement of left organisations not at this stage participating in the LULC</li> <li>Intervene in the CNWP to build a more effective campaign, transforming the CNWP into a real organization, and to campaign for: </li> </ul> <ul style="" 40px;&#8221="””””"> <li>The
CNWP to adopt a federal structure which encourages affiliation and
automatic representation and representation for independents</li> <li>The CNWP to establish working groups to develop the policy points in the CNWP Charter</li> <li>The CNWP to establish a timescale for turning the campaign for a new workers’ party into that actual party</li> <li>The
CNWP to launch a national debate designed to galvanize opinion around
such matters as the party name, aims, constitution, culture, and
programme.</li> <li> Through the LULC, and in the CNWP, seek to produce
a report on “The problems of forming one party for the socialist
movement” as an authoritative and representative report. </li> </ul> <ul style="" 40px;&#8221="””””””””””””"> <ul> </ul> </ul> <h2> IMPLEMENTING THE POLICY AGREED AT THE AGM</h2> <p>In the nine months since then, the following progress has been made:</p> <h3>LEFT UNITY LIAISON COMMITTEE (LULC) </h3> <p>The
LULC has now had five meetings, three of them since the 2008 AGM.
Reports from these meetings can be found on our web site. In terms of
specifics:</p> <ul> <li>The LULC has discussed the Peoples’ Charter,
and agreed to collate the various Charters from different left
organisations into one document.</li> <li>It was unanimously agreed to
support a proposal from the AGS that “The issue of the environment
should be a pillar of any new joint organisation”</li> <li>It was agreed to continue pursuing the objective of clash avoidance at elections</li> <li>It
was agreed that a Discussion Paper on possible aims of this Liaison
Committee be circulated, and subsequently it was agreed that the LULC
would provide mechanisms for an exchange of views, co-operation,
co-ordination, education, promotion of each other’s events, and unity
in action. The aim would be to build a more effective socialist
movement as a movement. </li> </ul> <p> In March, the LULC had a
lengthy discussion on the “No2EU-YestoDemocracy” RMT Euro Election
initiative, and in June there was an open and frank appraisal of the
No2EU Election Campaign, followed by a discussion about the way forward
after the European Elections, which included an analysis of the growing
calls for left unity from, amongst others, Bob Crow, Mark Serwotka,
Dave Nellist, the SWP and the AWL.</p> <p>All the main socialist and
green socialist organisations have attended LULC Meetings, apart from
the SWP, and in total 15 left groups have sent representatives to
discuss and promote left unity. These are the Socialist Party, Respect,
the Labour Representation Committee, the Campaign for a New Workers
Party, CPGB, Workers Power, the Democratic Labour Party, Workers
Liberty, the Communist Party (CPB), RDG, Socialist alliance, Green
Left, Alliance for Green Socialism, the United Socialist Party, Left
Alternative. The SWP have been invited, and they have acknowledged our
support for their proposed left conference. </p> <h3>* CAMPAIGN for a NEW WORKERS’ PARTY (CNWP) </h3> <p>The
Steering Committee and Officers have each only met once this year
because the CNWP gave immediate and full support to No2EU,
concentrating its efforts on building it. In the meantime, CNWP
supporters have been encouraged to become members, and 229 had done so
by July. A Steering Committee has been called for the end of October,
and there will be a Members Conference early in the New Year</p> <h3> * NO2EU-YESTO DEMOCRACY</h3> <p>”No2EU-YestoDemocracy”
- the coalition initiated by the RMT for the European Elections on June
4th – took up most of the left’s energy from March, and continues now
with post No2EU developments. The coalition was initially set up by the
RMT, CPB, AGS and SP. The CNWP soon gave its support. and, after a
lengthy discussion at a meeting of members, the Socialist alliance
agreed in late April to give critical support. This initially proved to
be too late to become part of the Core Group which has continued to
meet post No2EU to put together a coalition for the General election. </p> <p> </p> <p>Those
wanting the SA to engage with No2EU argued that the initiative should
be supported as a historic trade union based challenge to New Labour -
if the left could not get its act together at a time of severe economic
crisis and potential rise of the far right, then when could it? The
main reason for engagement was the project’s potential. Links would be
formed which would not necessarily disappear after June 4. The left was
increasingly coming onboard and Left groups were already able to use
the programme to promote their own slant. It would be an active
campaign with many public meetings, leaflets and stalls, and these
could help lay the basis for a new left party which would clearly have
trade union support. There would be a National TV broadcast. </p> <p>
The main policies of No2EU-yestodemocracy were to challenge the
undemocratic nature of the EU, and to counter the BNP. It did not call
for withdrawal from the EU, despite the impression which may have been
given in the registered electoral title. Full details of the manifesto
policies can be found at www.no2eu.com. There was some criticism within
the SA about the policies being too much of a concentration on the EU
as the cause of all our problems, and what could be described as
nationalistic solutions. However, two resolutions of critical support
were passed at the Members Meeting</p> <h3> THE NO2EU-YESTODEMOCRACY EURO ELECTION CAMPAIGN – AN ANALYSIS</h3> <p>
In the Euro election itself, the No2EU campaign averaged 1%, which was
not dissimilar from the SA in 2001 (1.62%) and only just behind the SLP
who had the name and had been in existence for 12 years. It was the
same % as the SSP got in Scotland on June 4, and this was despite an
absence of media coverage and only being in existence for 9 weeks. </p> <p>
However, the result, along with those for others on the left, pales
into insignificance compared to the results of the far right. UKIP
gained 17%, pushing Labour into 3rd place, and the BNP gained two MEPs,
both hard line fascists and racists. The left needs to address this
quickly. Divisions within the left made it easier for the far right to
pose as the ‘acceptable’ alternative to the political corruption and
reactionary policies of the establishment parties. Much of the BNP’s
more recent support comes from working class traditional Labour voters,
many of whom only move to the BNP as a protest. In my view, and my
experience, where I have had to actively campaign against BNP
candidates in my own ward 3 times recently, most could be won over by a
new left party which offered a radical alternative without the extreme
nationalism and racism of the BNP.</p> <p> The No2EU campaign itself
was a very active one with 150 Public Meetings/Rallies, 15 in the West
Midlands where SA National Secretary Pete McLaren had been a candidate
on the list headed by Dave Nellist. This meant the SA got mentioned in
West Midlands leaflets, and also in some of the eighteen press releases
in the West Midlands where Pete McLaren was also Press Officer. </p> <p>
There was a Freepost to 50% of the entire electorate, plus hundreds of
thousands of local leaflets with an organisation’s own uncensored
politics. There was a successful TV broadcast, especially against the
BNP. No2EU did provide a working class alternative to BNP by taking
them on – it gave a better option than just “Don’t vote BNP”. Most SA
members felt the No2 EU campaign had been significant – trade union
support was clearly there, specifically from the RMT, but the FBU made
a donation, and the PCS President spoke at the London Rally. Increasing
numbers of left groups had come on board – SP, CPB, AGS, Solidarity,
SA, ISG, Respect local branches. But it was the developments that could
well come out of it that provided the most compelling reason to have
got involved in the No2EU-Yestodemocracy campaign</p> <h3> DEVELOPMENTS POST NO2EU</h3> <p>As
noted in the resolutions agreed for engagement with the
No2EU-Yestodemocracy European Election challenge, the SA was hopeful
that something more permanent on the left would emerge from it. </p> <p>There
had already been a number of developments by the time the SA NEC next
met on June 21st, and I was able to report the following information I
had received from Dave Nellist to the meeting:</p> <p>The SP executive
had confirmed their wish to build on the work of NO2EU for a joint list
under a common name for the GE, starting as soon as possible; the CPB
and RMT were both meeting on July 11 to decide their view; there would
be a meeting of the core groups involved with No2EU in the 3rd week of
July to assess the way forward and this group was likely to
subsequently meet monthly; there would be campaigning amongst the Irish
community in Britain on the Lisbon Treaty referendum vote, including a
fringe meeting at the TUC with Joe Higgins; there would be a National
Convention after the TUC Conference to decide details, structures etc
for the GE</p> <p> I went on to report that Jane Godrich (PCS Pres),
Rob Griffiths (CPB Gen Sec), Dave Nellist, and Bob Crow had all
outlined the need for a unified <span style="" bold;&#8221="””””””””””””">left electoral challenge as a step towards a new left party</span>
at the London No2EU Rally on June 1st. Since then, a letter from Dave
Nellist had been published in a number of newspapers suggesting that
Labour’s decline and the BNP success showed the need for a left
political alternative. Bob Crow on the BBC news Blog had called for
urgent talks between socialist organizations and trade unions to build
a concerted political and industrial response to the election results,
especially the BNP’s success, adding that the 150,000 votes (obtained
by No2EU) provided a solid platform to build on. Mark Serwotka (Gen Sec
PCS) was quoted in a SWP Open Letter stating that working people can no
longer vote Labour – we need trade unions to stand candidates, he
suggested. </p> <p> In addition, a number of left organisations were
showing an increased willingness to work together. The SWP had
circulated an Open Letter calling for a left conference to discuss a
”single, united left alternative to Labour”, and there had already been
positive reactions to that, including one from the SA itself. In
addition, the AWL was calling for a new Socialist Alliance, and the
Socialist Party had produced a Paper outlining how they felt the left
should move forward, entitled ‘No2EU: A step towards a workers’
political voice’</p> <p> After a lengthy discussion at the NEC about
all these developments, much of which was about whether or not there
should be pre-conditions before the SA agreed to engage with post No2EU
political developments, it was decided pre-conditions were not
necessary and it was agreed to engage in any post No2EU Left
developments which broadly fit within our agreed policies as in our
Constitution. We welcomed the calls, by the SWP in their Open Letter,
the AWL call for a new Socialist Alliance, leading trade union figures
such as Bob Crow and Mark Serwotka, for unity in the upcoming General
Election, adding that we believed such moves, if they are to have any
reality, must be democratic and involve the widest possible working
class forces, without bans and proscriptions. We agreed to campaign
within any unity moves for the following conditions</p> <ul> <li>They are explicitly socialist, with a title and programme that reflects this;</li> <li>Their political programme is broadly in line with People Before Profit, the SA’s election manifesto;</li> <li>That they explicitly reject nationalism and xenophobia and stand for equal rights for all;</li> <li>That they stand for full equality for all, and make no concessions to national, communal or religious interests</li> <li>That
they recognise that this crisis is an environmental as well as economic
and any solutions must be sustainable for the planet as a whole.</li> </ul> <p>We
agreed to fight within any unity project for our SA programme, and the
NEC also recognized a “crisis of democracy” in the UK and agreed to
promote the development of a democratic programme within the CNWP,
Convention of the Left, No2EU and the LULC. </p> <p> The No2EU Core
Group has been informed of the SA’s decision to engage in any post
No2EU political developments, and we await their response. The Core
Group met on July 20, and CNWP Officers heard later that day that:</p> <ul> <li> There would be meetings in support of an Irish No Vote on the Lisbon treaty </li> <li>A
Left Electoral Coalition was now being discussed for the General
Election with a “class based electoral title” – an electoral block with
support from trade unions and left organizations.</li> <li> It was
hoped there would be agreement on a number of key demands, but
supporting organisations would also have to the freedom to promote
their own programme – a federal arrangement similar to how the SA
operated in 2001.</li> <li>The steering group may be widened to include
other supportative organisations, like the SA, after the next core
meeting on September 1</li> <li>There will be a national convention on the crisis in the lack of working class political representation in the autumn</li> </ul> <p>
The Core Group met again in September and agreed, (subject to
ratification by organisations), to form a coalition for the general
election. The next meeting would decide on a name and some core policy
points (covering socialist, democratic, environmental and trade union
issues). The Core Group would then look at the involvement of other
groups, and the general practicalities involved.</p> <p> </p> <h3>CONCLUSION</h3> <p>Overall
2009 has so far been a year of steady progress in terms of our agreed
priorities, and gradual progress towards the formation of a new
workers’ party. However, we remain very small in terms of membership,
and we only have two officers when we should have at least five. I
cannot continue forever to cover membership, finances and
communications as well as being Secretary. Our resources are severely
stretched. Yet, because of our background and tradition, we continue to
have an influence. We have avoided splits, despite some quite major
differences of opinion, particularly around No2EU.</p> <p> In terms of the specifics of the resolution passed at the last AGM, we have</p> <ul> <li>Helped to develop work to encourage the left to cooperate and work more closely and effectively together</li> <li>Assisted the CNWP to turn supporters into members</li> <li>Taken forward our campaign for One Party of the Left, within the LULC, No2EU and throughout the left wherever possible</li> <li>Worked
to gain the involvement of organistions not previously involved in the
LULC, including the CPB, and we have re-opened contact with the SWP</li> <li>Continued to intervene in the CNWP whenever possible</li> </ul> <p>
What we have not been able to do has been to move the CNWP further
forward. This has been largely because the CNWP was effectively put on
the back burner from March until October in preference to work building
the Euro Election coalition No2EU, and in the subsequent Post-No2EU
developments towards a coalition for the General Election. With only
one Steering Committee meeting, one Officers meeting and no annual
conference, it has not been possible to push it into being a more
effective campaign with automatic representation for affiliates, policy
working groups, a report on the problems of forming one left party or
the need for a time table for the campaign for a new workers’ party to
become that party. With a further Steering Committee called for the end
of October, agreement to hold a Conference early in the New Year, and
the move to a membership structure, the SA can now seek to promote
these policies within the CNWP with renewed vigor.</p> <p> More to the
point, it is what has objectively happened since last December, rather
than the specifics of a particular resolution, which should make us
optimistic about the future. There have clearly been a number of
positive moves towards greater left unity in the ten months since our
last AGM. </p> <p> The RMT initiated Euro Election challenge has, at
the same time, moved forward the campaign for a new left party and,
with our support, stood in all eleven regions of England, Wales and
Scotland. Although it was set up as an electoral coalition for just one
election, ‘No2EU’, for all its programmitical weaknesses, could well be
the catalyst for building a more permanent left party. In the 3 months
since the Euro Elections, the main ‘No2EU’ partners have laid the
ground for a coordinated left challenge at the General Election next
year. That would be a start. </p> <p> It was disappointing that
internal division delayed SA support for, and involvement in, ‘No2EU’,
with the result that we are not part of the main ‘Core’ Post ‘No2EU’
planning group, but we have now agreed to engage with these post
’No2EU’ developments, and hopefully we will soon be an active
component. This may well entail standing SA candidate(s) in the General
Election as part of this coalition, a decision which will have
financial and administrative implications we will need to address.</p> <p>
If we remain realistic about our role and our priorities, there is no
reason why we cannot continue to play a part in left wing politics as a
separate body. Our determination to bring unity across the socialist
and green socialist left is unique. We can continue to act as a sort of
pressure group for the unity of the left, arguing for it wherever we
have an audience, and promoting it through those wider projects within
which we have already demonstrated we have a role to play, including
the LULC, CNWP, ‘Post-No2EU developments and the Convention of the
Left. In many ways we are marking time, waiting for wider forces to
agree the need for a new left formation or party, whilst at the same
time ‘doing our bit’ to speed up that process.</p> <p> <span style="" bold;&#8221="””””””””””””">There has never been a more urgent time for the left to get its act together.</span>
With the establishment parties all vying to see which of them can best
make the working class pay for the Recession, through pay cuts,
unemployment and massive cuts in public services, and with the
continuing moves forward of the far right and the increased racism this
promotes, there is a desperate need for a socialist alternative. Die
Linke in Germany has shown what is possible in just two short years. In
many ways, it is a Left Party of compromise – but it is a Left Party.
We could do worse than follow its example. This may well mean accepting
that some of our agreed policies do not feature in the new Party’s core
programme, as we found with ‘No2EU-YestoDemocracy’. But it should not
prevent our engagement, and once inside, we can argue for all that we
hold dear, and, if appropriate, become a faction within the new
organization to do so. There is no point in the 6 or 7 of us on the NEC
preventing engagement because our own individual political crusade has
not been immediately recognized by whatever does emerge.</p> <p> The
main point is that we must accept that none of us on the left have a
monopoly of the truth; none of us know all the answers. What we do know
is that we get nowhere as long as we remain divided. As we discovered
in the early days of the original Socialist Alliance, we have more in
common than not. We united then around the 80%, or at times 90%, we
could agree upon. A federal structure then allows organizations,
including ourselves, to promote that other 10 or 20% as long as it is
not counter productive to the project as a whole. This has to be the
way forward. We must continue promoting it at every level, whilst being
realistic about the amount of influence we can have. Our commitment to
socialist unity is more than just unique – it is a vital component of
the new workers’ party we are committed to build.</p> <p> We live in
interesting times. There is a renewed interest in unity, a new desire
to provide a unified left alternative. There will be setbacks. Old
sectarianisms will die hard. But the important thing is for us to be in
there, as the Socialist Alliance, representing all the traditions and
achievements of the original SA, arguing for unity, openness,
bottom-upwards democracy, honesty and inclusivity. That way we very
much still have an important role to play, both as an independent
organization and, in the future, as some sort of faction, for want of a
better word, within something much larger, much more exciting, and with
real potential.</p><p style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Pete McLaren</span>, SA National Secretary 07/10/09</p><img class="panel_bottom" src="/content_BG_bottom.gif"/></div>
