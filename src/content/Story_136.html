<h1>2018 SA AGM agrees to continue promoting unity across the left, inside and outside the Labour party, on a class basis</h1>
<p></p><p>Here is the motion passed in full:</p><p>"<span>The
Socialist Alliance 2018 AGM agrees to continue the broad political direction
adopted at the 2016 AGM, and with the practical decisions taken at both the
2014 and 2016 AGMs.</span><span> </span><span>In doing so, the SA

been since the victory of Jeremy Corbyn in the Labour leadership elections,
coupled with the tremendous vote Labour under Corbyn achieved at the 2017
General Election</span></p>

for a socialist party uniting genuine socialist forces currently inside and
outside the Labour Party.</span></p>
