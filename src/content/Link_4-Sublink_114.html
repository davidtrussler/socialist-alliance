mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">–<b> REPORTS FROM THE TUSC STEERING COMMITTEE, TUSC
CONFERENCE AND ISN: ANALYSIS, AND HOW THE SA SHOULD RESPOND</b></span></p>

<p><span style="mso-ansi-language:
EN-GB">Pete McLaren circulated written reports.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"> </span>The Steering Committee had been an interesting
experience.<span> </span>He had now attended
three meetings on behalf of the ISN.<span> 
</span>The RMT, SWP and SP had attended all those meetings.<span> </span>There had been useful discussions about
the Council and recent By-election results.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"> </span>Attempts were being made to work with the CPB and Respect,
although neither seemed too keen on close cooperation.<span> </span>It had been agreed to set up a
Commission (working group) to discuss a future structure for TUSC, and he had
been elected as the ISN delegate.<span> 
</span>He would use that position to argue for greater democracy and wider
involvement.<span> </span>He had presented the
interim report to the TUSC Conference the previous day, summarising the seven
submissions so far received, and motivating the Rugby TUSC specific proposals
to gain participation and representation at national level from supporting
political groups, TUSC branches and TU branches – and for individual membership
to be considered.<span> </span>The September
ISN meeting had been well attended, and had spent some time pursuing ways TUSC
branches could be set up – he personally felt this was the key to opening TUSC
up, and he urged SA members to do as he had done in Rugby and meet with a
couple of local socialists to set a TUSC branch up.</span></p>

clear that, although they fully supported TUSC, they needed other trade unions
to get on board or, according to RMT President Alex Gordon, they might have to
reconsider</span></p>

some opposition from the SP to Socialist Resistance joining the TUSC Steering
