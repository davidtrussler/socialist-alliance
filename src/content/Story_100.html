last year Rugby TUSC was only set up on March 2nd, yet, within 2 months, it had selected 7 candidates, raised &pound;2,000 and delivered over 20,000 leaflets.<span> </span>He urged everyone present to go out to their anti cuts groups and local trade unions to stress the need for anti cuts candidates, and suggest they adopt the TUSC Against Cuts electoral title.<span> </span>The Elections were about continuing to build the anti cuts movement alongside building TUSC, he argued.<span> </span>He stressed the importance of gaining a profile in the local media with a constant stream of Media Releases, the drip, drip effect eventually working as the media sought an alternative to the pro-cuts views of the established parties &#8211; in Rugby 24 Media Releases in the last 10 months had resulted in 43 media articles centered around TUSC.<span> </span>He concluded by stressing the need to leaflet every household and engaging with voters by canvassing, stalls and street meetings.<span>  </span><i>Hannah Sell</i></span><span lang=\\"EN-US\\" style=\\"font-family:Times;

the local media had approached him for TUSC comment on trade union disputes.<span> </span></span><i>Hannah Sell</i><span> explained there were no rules for how widely TUSC should stand.<span> </span>She agreed we should go to anti cuts committees and trade union branches to discuss standing anti cuts candidates.<span> </span>She stressed the importance of talking to people, especially in workplaces, suggesting that we match up candidates with areas of work they are linked with e.g. a CWU candidate could lead a meeting at a Royal Mail Post Office, a POA member at a prison, an</span><span><b> </b></span>RMT member at a station &#8211;
