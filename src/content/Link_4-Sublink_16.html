<h2>MOTION 1 PRIORITIES FOR THE SOCIALIST ALLIANCE</h2>

<p>We recognise the progress made by the SA in the last 12 months towards implementing the tasks it was set by the 2006 AGM. We recognise the need to do more if the SA is to have a significant impact</p>

<p>We call upon the newly elected NEC to continue<br/>
Prioritising producing a regular SA publication, <br/>
Working with and developing SA branches, and <br/>
Working both within and across socialist unity projects.</p>

<p>Furthermore, we agree<br/>
To campaign, both ourselves as the SA and within the CNWP, for:<br/>
The CNWP to adopt a membership structure<br/>
The CNWP to adopt a federal structure which encourages affiliation and automatic representation from all supportive political organisations irrespective of size, and representation for independents<br/>
The CNWP to establish working groups to develop the agreed policy points in the CNWP Charter</p>

<p>For discussions to commence about how best to approach all socialist unity projects – including the CNWP, LRC, Respect/SWP, Respect Renewal, SGUC partners, CMP, DSA, tUSP, SUN, ISG, the RMT initiated National Shop Stewards Network, and other progressive red/green groups and individuals - with a view to inviting all socialist unity projects, left organisations and independent socialists to a conference in 2008 to discuss ways of uniting the left into one mass socialist, democratic, open and pluralist organisation which recognises and protects each component part whilst pursuing  commonly agreed goals.</p>

<h2>MOTION 2 CAMPAIGNING FOR A SOCIALIST ALLIANCE </h2>

<p>This AGM congratulates the Executive on securing the name and electoral registration of the Socialist Alliance for those who recognise the need for a socialist alliance. In promoting the Socialist Alliance and urging all socialists to join with us, we recognise we are a small organisation and that there is much work to be done before there is real unity of the left. Therefore our most urgent aim as the SA is to campaign for a new alliance of socialists which unites in one organisation the Labour Representation Committee, the CNWP, Respect, TUSP and the rest of the socialist and green socialist left, and is built on the principles enshrined in the work historically carried out by the Socialist Alliance. </p>

<h2>MOTION 3 CNWP</h2>

<p>The SA will continue to make a priority of our campaigning work with the CNWP. Our strategic aim is to transform the CNWP into an organisation along the lines of the original SA with local branches, a federal structure and programme along the lines of People Before Profit. We note that the Scottish Socialist Alliance was the launch pad for a new workers party, the Scottish Socialist Party. An alliance of socialists with unites the majority of the left can be part of a real movement for a workers party.</p>

<p>Noting the further restrictions by the Brown leadership on democracy in the Labour Party and the crisis in Respect, it is more urgent that the CNWP begins to transform itself into a real organisation. The SA will intervene in the CNWP and where possible carry out our own initiatives to win over the Socialist Party and its rank and files members to building a more effective campaign.</p>

<h2>MOTION 4 RESPECT</h2>

<p>This AGM notes the crisis in Respect (who are holding their conference at the same time as the Socialist Alliance AGM). We deplore any further fragmentation of the forces of the left, while retaining our criticism of its non-socialist features and cross-class, bureaucratic organisation. The incoming SA EC is charged with reporting to the Alliance on the state of play vis-&#224;-vis Respect and whether any new openings have arisen for our project of socialist unity.</p>

<h2>MOTION 5 PEOPLE BEFORE PROFIT</h2>

<p>This AGM calls on the incoming EC to begin the process of updating our manifesto People Before Profit, with a view to completing a new version by the May elections. This to be undertaken with the widest possible consultation with the membership, via meetings and e-discussion.</p>

<h2>MOTION 6 DAY SCHOOL </h2>

<p>This AGM recognises three major working class political traditions in Britain in Chartism, Labourism and Marxism.  Chartism produced the first mass militant working class party in Britain around a democratic programme. Chartism mobilised extra-parliamentary direct action uniting workers, trade unionists, socialists, reformists and Marxists around to fight for democracy.</p>
<p>Noting the article on Chartism in the recent TUSP magazine we resolve to organise a day school in February 2008 around theme of Chartism and democracy, if possible with the involvement of the TUSP and other interested socialist organisations. </p>

<h2>MOTION 7 CHARTER FOR A DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC</h2>

<p>This AGM notes the &#8220;Charter for a Democratic Republic&#8221; as set out below and resolves to encourage members to support the Charter and seek support from local contacts.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Charter for a Democratic Republic proclaims the sovereignty of the people. To this end we seek the establishment of a democratic secular republic based on:<br/>
A written constitution with a Bill of Rights<br/>
Abolition of the monarchy and the House of Lords <br/>
Proportional representation<br/>
Annual Parliaments<br/>
MPs subject to recall by a vote of their electors<br/>
Devolved power to community-based local government.&#8221;</p>

<h2> MOTION 8 ACCESSIBILITY</h2>

<p>Meetings of all members must be fully accessible to all members, whilst committee meetings must be fully accessible to those elected to attend</p><img class="panel_bottom" src="/content_BG_bottom.gif"/></div>
