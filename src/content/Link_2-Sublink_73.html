The Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition should continue in existence after the 2010 general election, remaining registered with the Electoral Commission and maintaining a structure that enables it to fulfil its core task.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>This is, essentially, to provide an opportunity for local groups of trade unionists, community campaigners and socialist organisations who want to stand candidates in elections to appear on the ballot paper, if they so wish, as part of a wider challenge &#8211; as TUSC candidates rather than as &quot;Independents&quot;.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial"> </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial">&#8226; <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>To this end, TUSC will endeavour to co-ordinate challenges in the Scottish Parliament elections, the Welsh Assembly elections and the local elections that will take place in May 2011.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>We will organise a conference in Autumn 2010 open to local groups who are planning to stand candidates in the 2011 local elections and Welsh Assembly elections, and will support the Scottish TUSC steering committee in organising a similar event to prepare for the Scottish elections.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial"> </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial">&#8226;

<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The basic TUSC core policy statement developed for the 2010 general election shall remain in place subject to any revision agreed by the steering committee.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>In addition supplementary policy statements shall be developed for the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly and local elections, to be discussed at the relevant conferences.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We also confirm that, as a federal &quot;umbrella&quot; organisation, participating organisations will continue to be able to produce their own supporting material, subject to electoral law, as was the practise successfully adopted in the general election campaign, which allowed different organisations and local campaigns to collaborate under a common banner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:4.0pt"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;
