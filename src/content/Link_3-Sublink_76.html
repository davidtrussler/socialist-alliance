We now have 3,495 supporters of the CNWP. In the affiliated trade unions CNWP supporters are running very effective campaigns calling for breaking the link with Labour and moving to support trade union candidates. In PCS a discussion is taking place on whether to back trade union candidates, and CNWP supporters are central to the campaign that they should do so. At the same time CNWP supporters have taken part in founding the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition (TUSC), which is the most significant current development towards an independent political electoral voice for the working class, particularly because it involves an important layer of trade union leaders and militants. We therefore welcome the decision of the TUSC steering committee to continue to develop TUSC. </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Times">In particular, we welcome TUSC&apos;s plan for a conference in January 2011 to bring together all of those trade unionist, socialist and anti-cuts campaigners who are intending to contest elections under the TUSC banner in 2011. The conference will aim to build the strongest possible TUSC electoral challenge in 2011.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Such a challenge will have a very important role to play in trying to give a political voice to the anti-cuts campaigns which are going to develop.</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Times">However, we also recognise that TUSC is still at an early stage of development and does not yet constitute a new workers&apos; party.
