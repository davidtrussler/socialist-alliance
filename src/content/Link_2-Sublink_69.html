<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><b>MAIN
DISCUSSION ITEM – A STRATEGY FOR THE COMING STRUGGLES AND HOW THEY COULD BE
LINKED </b></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><i>Pete
McLaren</i></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> (SA)
began the discussion by wondering if there was enough information yet as to
where specifically the cuts would fall.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Anti cuts campaigns were beginning to emerge, in Coventry for example,
but the level of anger would take time to gauge and relate to.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>He expressed some concern that the
argument for the left to join/re-join the Labour Party was gaining prominence,
arguing that the lack of internal party democracy and any pretence at socialism
made that a non starter for most on the left.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">The
following were among the points made in the discussion:</span></p>

<ul style="margin-top:0cm" type="square">
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">The Budget cuts of 25%
   across Departments was unworkable; more would thus come off benefits</span></li>
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Although the cuts will be
   huge, profits are likely to rise</span></li>
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">There is an unprecedented
   programme of cuts across Europe, and responses will be replicated</span></li>
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Initially, no Trade Union
   leaders said they would fight the cuts, although Bob Crow has done so
   recently</span></li>
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">All we can do is to wait
   until the action starts</span></li>
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">29 million people voted
   for pro-cuts parties, 300,000 against</span></li>
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Consciousness is not
   high, and many think the Budget was acceptable</span></li>
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">The impact of the cuts
   will shake that up</span></li>
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">We need political
   arguments as well as industrial struggle – the vote on AV next May gives
   the left an opportunity</span></li>
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">The Party question is
   becoming more important, taking up demands like nationalization of the
   banks and parliamentary reform</span></li>
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Voters only returned to
   Labour out of desperation, and because there was no actual or perceived
   alternative</span></li>
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">We urgently need to build
   a Left alternative, within 12 months.<span style="mso-spacerun:
   yes"> </span>We must support industrial struggle, but, in itself,
   that is not enough</span></li>
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">There will be massive
   attacks on the working class – either we fight back, or there will be
   misery</span></li>
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">There will be serious
   affects of the cuts in areas like the NE where half the economy is based
   on the public sector</span></li>
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">State intervention, as
   with Northern Rock, gives us an opening into the debate about public
   ownership and the need for democracy</span></li>
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">We need to explain what
   should be done instead of the cuts</span></li>
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">We must respond to the
   fast tracking of Academies</span></li>
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">The left has much it
   agrees about, including nationalization and democratic control – why can’t
   we all be in one Party?</span></li>
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">How will left trade
   unionists react if they are told to implement cuts on others, eg in
   Benefit Offices?</span></li>
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">There will be parallels
   with the anti poll tax struggle in terms of the explosive mood that will
   develop, but there are also differences as the cuts will be more
   generalized</span></li>
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">People voted Labour or
   even Lib Dem to keep the Tories out, not to support cuts</span></li>
</ul>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">In
terms of strategy, <i>Martin Thomas</i></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> suggested</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:72.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt;mso-list:l0 level2 lfo1;
tab-stops:list 72.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:
Wingdings">v<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">  </span></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">There needs to be a fight back
across Europe to unite workers</span></p>

tab-stops:list 72.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:
Wingdings">v<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">  </span></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">As international finance
markets have enormous powers to influence governments, we must raise the issue
of public ownership and democratic control of financial institutions</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:72.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt;mso-list:l0 level2 lfo1;
tab-stops:list 72.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:
Wingdings">v<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">  </span></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">We must fight for greater
democracy within trade unions and the TUC</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:72.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt;mso-list:l0 level2 lfo1;
tab-stops:list 72.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:
Wingdings">v<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">  </span></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">We need more than just one day
general strikes as in Greece</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:72.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt;mso-list:l0 level2 lfo1;
tab-stops:list 72.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:
Wingdings">v<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">  </span></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Part of the fight back will be
in and around the Labour Party, and the left should work through affiliated
unions to demand the restoration of democracy within the Labour Party</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Times"></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><i>Gerry
Byrne</i></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> spoke
about the public sector trade union alliance that had been launched in the NE</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><i>Clive
Heemskerk</i></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
argued we should already be organizing against the Academies that have been
identified, and demand a ballot of all affected parents as the Lib Dems successfully
did in Sheffield in 2008.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>We
should be </span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Times">positive – the SP
membership had risen to nearly 2,000, the best since 1983.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>We are on the verge of an unprecedented
period of history, he argued, and how we relate to it is important.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>It is also important that Bob Crow and
other left TU leaders help to build a new left party, as is happening through
TUSC</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Times"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><b>NATIONAL
MEETING OF PROGRESSIVE, COMMUNITY AND SOCIALIST PARTIES IN RUGBY ON JULY 24th,
AND DEVELOPMENTS WITHIN TUSC </b></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><i>Pete
McLaren </i></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">explained
how the initiative had developed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>All locally registered community/socialist parties like the Barrow
Socialist Peoples Party had been invited, as had all national left/green left
organizations that saw the need to build a left alternative to Labour.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The aims of the meeting were </span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Times">to share good practice, network with each
other and discuss the establishment of a national network body of regional and
local parties with a representative from each affiliated organisation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>It was also hoped to f<span style="color:black">eed into any discussions on the formation of a new party of
the left, but not try and launch one on July 24th!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Separately, he circulated the future
steps agreed by the TUSC Steering Committee. I</span>ts core task was to
provide an opportunity for local groups of trade unionists, community
campaigners and socialist organisations to stands as TUSC candidates in
forthcoming elections.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>It will
continue with a Steering Committee as presently constituted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Other organization s could apply to
join.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>It was accepted that this
structure was only an interim arrangement and that discussions will need to
take place on the best way to organise the coalition as it develops, with a
broader conference to include a debate on this issue in 2011.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>There would be a Conference in Autumn
2010 open to local groups who are planning to stand candidates 2011.</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Times"> </span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Times"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Finally,
he referred to a recent meeting of CNWP Officers which had agreed a motion from
the SA to establish the prototype of a new Left Party in the next 18 months and
discuss its constitution.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>It had
also been agreed to organise a Members Meeting taking resolutions, like a mini
Conference, in September, and a full Conference in the first half of 2011.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Times"><i>Gerry Byrne</i></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Times"> expressed concern that both TUSC and the
Rugby initiative were framed around electoral challenges.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>She also felt TUSC lacked structure and
democracy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>It was, she felt, a
Coalition of important individuals and representatives from the SP and SWP, and
not from other supporting organizations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Whereas that could be justified in order to mount a General Election
challenge, that was no longer the case.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>TUSC should be broadened, she argued.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"> </span>She was also not clear about the role of the CNWP alongside
TUSC.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Times"><i>Dave Church</i></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Times"> expressed the concern of DLP members at
the absence of a national structure they could join.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"> </span>He hoped TUSC would become more democratic, and he expressed
concern that the CNWP was little closer to building the party it was
campaigning for.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Times"><i>Steve Freeman</i></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Times"> felt we needed to move faster than we had
been doing towards the creation of a new Left party.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"> </span>All we had at present were electoral fronts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The working class were more likely to
continue moving back to Labour in the continuing absence of such a new Party, a
Party which needed to be socialist, democratic and republican, he concluded.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Times"><i>Pete McLaren </i></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Times">pointed to the CNWP report he had
circulated – it showed the CNWP had made moves towards planning for a new Left
Party by adopting the SA resolution with its 18 month time limit without any
opposition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>TUSC could move the
process further forward, although he agreed it should be broadened out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Times"><i>Clive
Heemskerk</i></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Times"> agreed that no
one wanted to move slowly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Discussions were on going. We had to take reality into account
however.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Even the RMT leadership
was becoming under pressure to reconsider its relationship with the Labour
Party, and support for rejoining Labour was growing in many trade unions</span></p>
