text-autospace:none"><span><b></b></span></p><b><p><span>TUSC’s
election results were a modest improvement on last year.<span> </span>Standing mostly as Trade Unionists and
Socialists Against Cuts, TUSC stood a total of 133 candidates in England and
Wales on May 3, standing in 132 wards in 40 Councils, proportionally a higher
number of candidates than last year. In addition TUSC stood in the
Liverpool Mayoral contest and for the GLA. In total these candidates
polled 43,671 votes.</span></p></b><p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none"><span><b></b></span></p><b><p><span>In the
Council Elections TUSC averaged 6.2%, up on last year’s 5.2%. The increase was
even greater in the 74 wards where there had also been a TUSC candidate in 2011
– an average of 6.8% compared to 5.4%.<span> 
</span>The overall average of 6.2% is the best performance in local elections
for a long time for a far left/ socialist party/coalition<b>. </b></span><span> </span></p></b><p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none"><span><b></b></span></p><b><p><span>TUSC
gained two councilors – Michael Lavelette in Preston and Pete Smith in
Walsall.<span> </span>Sadly Dave Nellist
lost his Coventry St Michaels seat by just 204 votes, nearly wiping out a
Labour majority of 1,200 two years ago. St Michaels is a very transient
ward with an annual population turnover of up to 30%.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"> </span>The Socialist Party had done well to have held on to it for
so long.</span></p></b><p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none"><span><b></b></span></p><b><p><span>TUSC
averaged 0.8% in the GLA elections, comparable to past regional and national
results – the Socialist Alliance averaged 0.98% at its highpoint when it stood
98 candidates in the 2001 General Election.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"> </span>Tony Mulhearn did well in Liverpool, coming 5th
out of 12 with 4.86%, beating the Tories, UKIP and the BNP, and finishing less
than 4% off 2nd place.</span></p></b><p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none"><span><b></b></span></p><b><p><span>Another
measure for our supporters is the ratio of TUSC votes to Labour.<span> </span>Last year it was 1:10, this year
1:9.<span> </span>A modest improvement, but
much more marked in areas TUSC had developed a local campaigning branch.<span> </span>In my own town of Rugby, for example,
the ratio was 1:3 – one TUSC vote for every three Labour votes.<span> </span>In fact, Rugby TUSC doubled its votes,
averaging 10% over 8 wards, an increase of 2.8%.</span></p></b><p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none"><span><b><b></b></b></span></p><b><b><p><span>Building
campaigning TUSC branches is the way forward, along with making TUSC
accountable and acceptable to the left who don’t believe Labour is, or can be,
a workers’party.<span> </span>We need to start building
TUSC into a Party, uniting the left in the process, campaigning under that name
on every issue affecting the working class to build its profile and develop
deeper roots within communities. Standing in elections is just part of
that process.</span></p></b></b><b><p></p></b><p></p>
