and subsequent Post-No2EU developments.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Both represent a huge step in the right direction &#8211; Left Coalitions with Trade Unionist backing for both the Euro and next General Election moves the whole party building process significantly forward, and, indeed helps shape that Party.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>This puts renewed pressure on us as the campaign for a new workers&apos;

All establishment parties are striving to make workers pay for the crisis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>With no left alternative being offered, workers are turning to the Far Right in significant numbers as a protest vote, many of whom could be won back if there was that working class alternative.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>On the other hand, there is a new mood for unity across the left, not seen since the high point period of the original Socialist Alliance around the time it stood 98 candidates in the 2001 General Election.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Calls for the left to work together, and for a unified left electoral challenge, have been made recently by a number of Trade Union leaders, including Jane Godrich (PCS Pres), Bob Crow (RMT Gen Sec) and Mark Serwotka (Gen Sec PCS).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Leaders of socialist organizations have gone further, calling for a new workers&apos;

including left organizations, trades unionists, those opposed to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and those campaigning on environmental issues, pensions, racism and tenants rights, encouraging all such organisations to work towards unity at their own pace.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The only structure that could possibly reflect and represent such diversity would be federal, recognizing the traditions and backgrounds of each &quot;˜sector&apos; whilst campaigning together on agreed policies and projects &#8211; around the 80 or 90% we can all agree upon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>That may, especially in the short term, mean accepting that organizations would act in their own name whilst making it clear they are also a part of the Party as a whole.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>In elections, for example, if an organization has built roots under its own electoral title, it may wish to retain that title &#8211; taking the Socialist Party as an example, this could mean standing as &quot;˜Socialist Alternative (the SP&apos;s registered electoral title) as part of the &apos;Left Workers Party&apos; or whatever.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;

What we now need to do is to encourage more and more supporters to become members, to hold the regional meetings on a more consistent basis, and set up the local branches of the CNWP.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>We will then need to define the relationship of these branches to the regional meetings, and vica versa, and the relationship of both to the national Steering Committee.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>That will be the first steps towards defining a structure that suits the Campaign for a New Workers&apos; Party and be able to evolve as we move into a being an actual Party.</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none; text-autospace:none"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Times;mso-ansi-language: EN-US"> </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;

political organisations, trade unions, tenant and community groups, women, black groups, organisations opposed to racism and other forms of exploitation, and, of course, independents, all separately and in their own right, no one group is so likely to dominate anyway.</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
