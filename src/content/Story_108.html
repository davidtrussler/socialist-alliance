			<h1>Obituary: Dave Spencer – founding member of the Socialist Alliance</h1>
			<p></p><p><b>DAVE
SPENCER</b></p>

<p>Dave Spencer was
active in local and national politics for over 50 years from his time in
Apartheid and CND, as a left wing Labour County Councillor, and as an activist
helping to build the Labour left in Coventry in the 1970s and the Socialist
Alliance in the 1990’s.</p>

<p><span> </span></p>

<p><span>Dave was a member
of the Labour Party Young Socialists (LPYS) in the 1960’s, at a time when the
SLL dominated that organization and made it difficult to hold open
discussion.<span> </span>Dave helped persuade
his local Coventry Labour party to open up its headquarters and a downstairs
area was turned into a sort of youth club where young people could meet up
without fear of intimidation.<span> </span>Dave
helped pioneer this.<span> </span>He remained
active in the Labour party, and became one of the first Marxists to be elected
as a Labour candidate when he won a seat on the West midlands County
Council.<span> </span>He helped build up a
genuine Labour Left within his own Constituency and Coventry District Labour
Party, and was part of the Left that took control in Coventry in the
1980’s.<span> </span>It was at this time that
Dave, as an FE lecturer, set up a the Eburne Project, named after the deprived
area of Coventry where he based his scheme to encourage working class people,
especially women, back into education.<span> 
</span>The Project was acclaimed locally and nationally, and a number of women
in particular became empowered through it.</span></p>

<p><span> </span></p>

<p><span>He helped set up the very
first Socialist Alliance in Coventry and Warwickshire in 1992 with, amongst
others, Dave Nellist and myself after 127 of us were all expelled from the
Labour party – although Dave remained inside the party a little longer.<span> </span>He did as much as anyone to build that
local SA into a fighting force with over 300 supporters, sitting on its
Organisation Committee and helping with its monthly Newsletter – indeed, we
used to meet at his house in Earlsdon to produce it every month.<span> </span>He helped build the SA nationally over
the next six years, and attended all the national meetings.<span> </span>Not always on the same political side
as Dave during these years – he backed a deposed Labour Party MEP against the
SA in the 1999 Euro Elections for example – I always appreciated that Dave
continued to work tirelessly for and with the SA nationally as it became a
large orgnanisation and stood 98 candidates in the 2001 General Election.<span> </span>He remained active locally also,
despite some political differences which remained after 1999.<span> </span>He helped us try and prevent the SWP
from closing down the SA in 2005, and was a leading member of the Socialist
Alliance Democracy Platform within it.<span> 
</span>When the SA was re-launched later that year, Dave did not agree with the
direction it took and he did not re-join locally or nationally.<span> </span>This is when he joined the Democratic
Socialist Alliance, which had split from the re-launched SA.<span> </span>However, he was happy to remain on the
local CAWSA mailing list, and he attended most of the local socialist events
that have taken place in the last few years.<span> </span>We remained in touch, and we always spoke together at these
events</span></p>

<p><span> </span></p>

<p><span>Dave always spoke his mind
and was never really in anyone&apos;s "camp" – this meant he would take on
other socialists he disagreed with in quite a an assertive way!<span> </span>He was a member of many different
trotskyist groups at various stages of his political life, though pointedly
never the Militant/SP</span></p>

<p><span> </span></p>

<p><span>The fact that there were
hundreds of comrades at the Celebration of his life that was held earlier in
May speaks volumes about Dave.<span> 
</span>People traveled from all over the country to pay their last respects,
many with an individual story to tell about how Dave influenced the development
of socialism.<span> </span>The music played at
the Crematorium was the music of protest – so fitting for the person dubbed by
the local newspaper as ‘Champion of the less fortunate’.<span> </span>What an accurate epitaph.</span><span></span></p><p>Dave had very sadly and suddenly died on April 24th</p><p><span><i>Pete McLaren</i> SA National Secretary</span></p>
