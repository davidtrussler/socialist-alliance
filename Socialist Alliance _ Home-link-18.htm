			<h1>SA AGM December 2nd, 3pm, Lucas Arms, Grays Inn Rd (near Kings Cross). There is one resolution:</h1>
			<p></p><p>

</p><p><span><b>RESOLUTION TO
THE 2012 SA AGM FROM PETE McLAREN</b></span></p>

<p>At last year’s AGM, the Socialist Alliance re-iterated is
commitments to left unity and the formation of a new Left Party based solidly
within the working class.<span> </span>In doing
so, it agreed a number of specific points, all subsequently being implemented
to varying degrees:</p>

<ul>
 <li>We
  found out rather too easily that left organisations no longer supported
  the LULC, and appeared not to give the concept of left unity any
  priority.<span> </span>There was not even
  any support for our idea of creating a Left Notice Board<span>   </span><span></span></li>
 <li>At
  our instigation, the CNWP agreed to “put itself on ice” whilst TUSC
  developed<span></span></li>
 <li>We
  continued to work to build TUSC, and encouraged local TUSC branches to be
  set up, preferably with structure and membership <span></span></li>
 <li><span>We campaigned within TUSC to ensure the
  principles agreed at the July 2011 TUSC Conference were put into practice,
  and our secretary stood as a TUSC anti cuts candidate</span></li>
 <li><span>Individual SA members worked within TUSC to
  implement the agreed policy </span>of it broadening out its structure at
  national level to welcome representation from local TUSC branches as well
  as trade union branches, political organisations and independents
  supportive of TUSC, with varying degrees of success</li>
 <li><span>SA
  members have worked hard within the ISN to develop it as a campaigning
  organization within TUSC</span></li>
 <li><span>We
  have not (yet) worked for the SA to become a faction within TUSC, and we
  have remained as the SA with our members heavily immersed within the ISN
  and/or TUSC</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span> </span></p>

<p><span>In the next period, the SA agrees, in its limited way
given its declining membership, to continue campaigning for left unity and for
a new Left Party based solidly within the working class.<span> </span></span></p>

<p><span>Specifically, the SA will:</span></p>

<ul>
 <li><span>Continue
  working to build the ISN as a campaigning organization offering a warm
  welcome to independent socialists</span></li>
 <li><span>Work
  within TUSC to help move it forwards in as democratic a way as possible,
  and, in particular, to:</span></li>
 <ul>
 <li><span>Ensure
  that it develops a structure which is inclusive of representatives of
  TUSC branches, supportive left organizations and supportive trade union
  branches, alongside independent socialists, at all levels</span></li>
 <li><span>Help
  devise a method of defining how that representation would accurately
  reflect the numbers of TUSC supporters in each organization</span></li>
 <li><span>Initiate
  discussions as to how leading left trade unionists from TUs not ready to
  commit to TUSC can continue to play a significant role in its development</span></li>
 <li><span>Consider
  how trade unions and political organizations could be encouraged to
  formally affiliate to TUSC</span></li>
 <li><span>Suggest
  TUSC adopts an individual membership structure which, alongside any
  affiliations, and inclusions of supporting left organizations, trade
  unions and individual trade unionists, enshrines the principle of One
  Person One Vote with sufficient checks to prevent any one group or block
  dominating the whole, and acknowledges the need to reflect the numbers of
  TUSC supporters within organizations/unions</span></li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p><span>In addition, and quite separately, the SA will amend
its constitution to state that, although the NEC will continue to meet at least
three times a year, two of those meetings could be on line through email
discussion.<span> </span>The AGM and at least
one NEC meeting per year will continue to be face to face as usual</span></p>

<p><span> </span></p>

<p><span> </span></p>

<p><span><b>CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT from Pete McLaren</b></span></p>

<p><span>Change Clause C5 to replace ‘The National Executive
will meet at least three times a year’ with </span></p>

<p><span>“The NEC will continue to meet at least three times a
year, two of those meetings could be on line through email discussion.<span> </span>The AGM and at least one NEC meeting
per year will continue to be face to face as usual”</span></p>

<p><span> </span></p>
